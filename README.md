## Basics

Welcome to your Moovweb project! Moovweb is a great way to build a compelling front-end for a website. The files in this project describe the changes we want to make to the front end of a site. There's places in this project to add new images (assets/images/), styles (assets/stylesheets/) and even manipulate HTML (scripts/).

## Before Running This

To run this project, you must have the Moovweb SDK installed on your system. Installation is easy - just go to [the download page on the Moovweb site](http://console.moovweb.com/download) to download and install.

We have lots of informative guides, videos, live help, documentation, and even a book on how to use Moovweb. You should be able to get up and running in 30 minutes if you visit [console.moovweb.com](http://console.moovweb.com).

You might find [the page about the scripts folder](http://console.moovweb.com/learn/reference/configuration/pages) useful for starting to write Tritium, and our [documents on the stylesheets folder](http://console.moovweb.com/learn/reference/configuration/stylesheet) for information on how we structure our stylesheets.

## Launching

Typically, on Mac or Linux, just browse to this project folder in a terminal and then run the following command:

    sudo moov server --auto-hosts

Then, just browse to [mlocal.cachemeifyoucan.hamptoncatlin.com](http://mlocal.cachemeifyoucan.hamptoncatlin.com) and you are ready to start developing!
